title: AccountRequestPostRequest
type: object
description: >-
  Used by: PISP

  This is the message that the DFSP sends to the PISP to inform the PISP that 
  the accountRequest has been accepted, and to communicate to the PISP which 
  `authChannel` it should use to authenticate their user with. I.e. it is a response to a
  POST /tppAccountsRequest request, or a GET /tppAccountsRequest/{ID} request.

  When a PISP requests a series of permissions from a DFSP on behalf of a DFSP's customer, 
  not all the permissions requested may be granted by the DFSP. Conversely, 
  the out-of-loop authorization process may result in additional privileges 
  being granted by the account holder to the PISP. The `PUT /tppAccountsRequest/<ID>` 
  resource returns the current state of the permissions relating to a particular authorization request.
