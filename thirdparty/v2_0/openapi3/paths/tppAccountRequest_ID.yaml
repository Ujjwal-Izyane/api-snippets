  summary: PostAccountRequest
  description: |
    The `POST /tppAccountsRequest/{ID}` is used to request access from the user to distribute account information from the user DFSP to the PISP.
    The *{ID}* in the URI should contain the accountRequestId that was assigned to the
    request by the PISP when the PISP originated the request. The result is return via the PUT callback.

  summary: UpdateAccountRequest
  description: |
    A DFSP uses this callback to (1) inform the PISP that the accountRequest has been accepted,
    and (2) communicate to the PISP which `authChannel` it should use to authenticate their user
    with.

    When a PISP requests a series of permissions from a DFSP on behalf of a DFSP's customer, 
    not all the permissions requested may be granted by the DFSP. 
    Conversely, the out-of-loop authorization process may result in additional privileges 
    being granted by the account holder to the PISP. The `PUT /tppAccountsRequest/<ID>` 
    resource returns the current state of the permissions relating to a particular 
    authorization request.
